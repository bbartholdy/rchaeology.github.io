By now you have most likely heard of the Fediverse. Lately it has gained
momentum
due to the acquisition of Twitter and its subsequent demise, causing
so-called 'migrations' to other platforms. Among them, Mastodon, one small
part of the Fediverse.

If not, or you want
to learn more, see [below](#what-fediverse). The Rchaeology community now
has a [Mastodon](https://archaeo.social/@Rchaeology) account and a chat on 
Element/Matrix (Slack alternative). Both are hosted on [archaeo.social](about.archaeo.social).
Both are open source!

## Join our platforms

You can access our platforms in a variety of different ways.
Element is a common app to access a matrix chat. You can create a free
account on the [matrix server](https://app.element.io/#/register)
or on [archaeo.social](https://chat.archaeo.social/#/register). If neither of
those options are your particular cup of tea, you can locate a server on this
[list](https://joinmatrix.org/servers/). Or if you want complete control
over your data, you can host your own server and join the conversations!

If you use Thunderbird you can also access the matrix chats there, or
use RSS feed readers to follow Mastodon accounts. That's the beauty of
the open standard protocols underlying the Fediverse!


We still have a Twitter account and a Slack workspace, but the hope is that
these will eventually be phased out.


If you use an RSS feed or Thunderbird you can also subscribe to our Mastodon toots by
adding <https://archaeo.social/@Rchaeology.rss> to your feed! If you didn't know that
you can subscribe to RSS feeds with Thunderbird, see [this cool blog post](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/05/thunderbird-rss-feeds-guide-favorite-content-to-the-inbox/)!

There are costs associated with running the archaeo.social server,
so please consider donating via [opencollective](https://opencollective.com/archaeosocial).

## What is the Fediverse {#what-fediverse}

> The fediverse is a collection of community-owned, ad-free, decentralised, and privacy-centric social networks.

The concept is similar to that of email. Just because you have your email
account with outlook, gmail, or proton, doesn't mean you are limited to
communicating with others with an account with the same company. That would be very
limiting and REALLY annoying. Yet, this is exactly what's happening with social
media platforms. If you're on Twitter (sorry, X...) you're limited to interacting
with others on Twitter. Facebook with other users on Facebook.
Sure, you can cross-post between Facebook and Instagram, but that's still within
Meta platforms, so they are in control.
