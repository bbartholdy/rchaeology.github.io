## New Website

To increase our visibility, we have launched a new website (which you have obviously 
already found) using the [Hello Friend NG](https://github.com/rhazdon/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng) [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) theme, with some slight tweaks.

## Goals

With this new platform, we aim to provide a convenient, centralised location for all your Rchaeological needs, from general R resources for beginners, to more advanced R topics in archaeology and related disciplines.

We will offer occasional posts on various topics on a completely unpredictable schedule. You can subscribe to our RSS feed [here](https://rchaeology.github.io/posts/index.xml).

## Contribute

You can contribute to the website via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rchaeology/rchaeology.github.io).
