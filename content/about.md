## Rchaeology

Rchaeology is a community for archaeologists who use, and want to learn [R statistical software](https://cran.r-project.org/).

### Goals {#goals}

We aspire to make the R programming language accessible to all archaeologists, and
provide an open, welcoming community for all those who are interested in learning.
We also want to help Rchaeologists find one another, whether for collaboration,
getting help with field-specific R questions, or just to nerd out and chat about R.

### Join Us {#join}

You can join us on one of our platforms to participate in the discussions and journal
clubs, share your experiences (especially difficulties), get help with code issues,
and promote your own R-related research in archaeology. Shameless self-promotion is
encouraged!
